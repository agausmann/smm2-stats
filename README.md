# SMM2 Stats

Analyzing courses from Super Mario Maker 2 for fun and profit!

The current objective is to gather the relative frequencies of objects appearing in courses to make
a prediction between two objects about which one will be seen first.

Automatically downloading levels is made possible through the [mm2 API][mariover] by TheGreatRambler.

Much of the level parsing and decryption was ported from [toost] by TheGreatRambler, which in turn
was based on [work by JiXiaomai][jixiaomai].

I couldn't have achieved this without these incredible projects, so thank you!
